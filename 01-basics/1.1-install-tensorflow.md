# Lab 2.1 : Up and Running With TensorFlow

### Overview
We will be running TensorFlow in a single node mode.

### Depends On 
None

### Run time
20 mins

## STEP 0: To Instructor
Please go through this lab on 'screen' first.

## STEP 1: Login to your TensorFlow node
Instructor will provide details

## STEP 2: Preparing Install

On linux, you will need to insure that the proper development libraries
are installed.


```bash
   $ sudo apt-get install python-dev python3-dev  #Ubuntu/Debian
```

```bash
   $ sudo apt-get install python-devel python3-devel  #Redhat/Centos
```

You then need to make sure that you have a proper version of Python. 
Windows users are highly recommended to install anaconda for Python v3.

http://www.anaconda.com/download


## STEP 3: Installing TensorFlow And Keras

Option 1: Installing with Pip

```bash
    $   pip3 install tensorflow keras
```

Option 2: Installing with Anaconda (if you have anaoconda)
```bash
    $   conda install tensorflow
    $   conda install keras
```

If you have trouble with conda command, you can try installing with pip.

## STEP 3: Testing TensorFlow


Enter this program in your python

```python
   >>> import tensorflow as tf
   >>> hello = tf.constant('Hello, TensorFlow!')
   >>> sess = tf.Session()
   >>> print(sess.run(hello))
```

You should get the following output
```console
   Hello, TensorFlow!
```

bingo!  Now we have tensorflow running.


## STEP 5: Download TensorFlow labs
```bash
    $   cd
    $   git clone   git@github.com:elephantscale/tensorflow-labs.git

    # $  cd  ~/tensorflow-labs
    # $  git checkout master

```

This will create a `tensorflow-labs` directory that has all the labs.
