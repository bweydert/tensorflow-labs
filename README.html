<p>These are labs for our Deep Learning with Tensorflow and Keras course.</p>
<h2 id="running-the-labs">Running the Labs</h2>
<p>There are two main ways we recoommend running the Labs:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Locally</li>
<li>Hosted on <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/">Google Colaboratory</a></li>
</ol>
<h4 id="running-locally">Running Locally</h4>
<p>To Run locally, we recommend downloading and installing <a href="https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/#download-section">Anaconda</a></p>
<p>Here is the URL for your copy-and-pasting pleasure:</p>
<p><code>https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/#download-section</code></p>
<p>Make certain you download Anaconda for Python version <strong>3</strong>, <strong>NOT</strong> Python version <strong>2</strong>.</p>
<h4 id="running-with-google-colaboratory">Running with Google Colaboratory</h4>
<p><a href="./colab-intro.html">Here</a> is a guide for running with Google Colaboratory.</p>
<h2 id="for-instructor">For instructor</h2>
<h3 id="aws-option-1">AWS option 1</h3>
<p>Recommend running with the <code>deeplearning</code> AMI, which is a fork of Amazonâ€™s DL AMI.</p>
<p>Start a new EC2 Instance as follows: * AWS us.east region * p2.xlarge instance type. * make sure network has public IP address * <code>deeplearning</code> AMI * <code>hi.pem</code> key * <code>ubuntu</code> security group.</p>
<h3 id="aws-option-2">AWS option 2</h3>
<p>I used instances c4.4xlarge, at $0.80/hour, or $200/day for 10 students.</p>
<p>For more than 5 students, you may want to stop them after the class and restart in the morning.</p>
<p>The speed that you get with these is 2 times faster than my fast Mac.</p>
