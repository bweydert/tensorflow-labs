    "_Phrase modeling_ is another approach to learning combinations of tokens that together represent meaningful multi-word concepts. We can develop phrase models by looping over the the words in our reviews and looking for words that _co-occur_ (i.e., appear one after another) together much more frequently than you would expect them to by random chance. The formula our phrase models will use to determine whether two tokens $A$ and $B$ constitute a phrase is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{count(A\\ B) - count_{min}}{count(A) * count(B)} * N > threshold$$\n",
    "\n",
    "...where:\n",
    "* $count(A)$ is the number of times token $A$ appears in the corpus\n",
    "* $count(B)$ is the number of times token $B$ appears in the corpus\n",
    "* $count(A\\ B)$ is the number of times the tokens $A\\ B$ appear in the corpus *in order*\n",
    "* $N$ is the total size of the corpus vocabulary\n",
    "* $count_{min}$ is a user-defined parameter to ensure that accepted phrases occur a minimum number of times\n",
    "* $threshold$ is a user-defined parameter to control how strong of a relationship between two tokens the model requires before accepting them as a phrase\n",
    "\n",
    "Once our phrase model has been trained on our corpus, we can apply it to new text. When our model encounters two tokens in new text that identifies as a phrase, it will merge the two into a single new token.\n",
    "\n",
    "Phrase modeling is superficially similar to named entity detection in that you would expect named entities to become phrases in the model (so _new york_ would become *new\\_york*). But you would also expect multi-word expressions that represent common concepts, but aren't specifically named entities (such as _happy hour_) to also become phrases in the model.\n",

For this demo, we'll be using [*Latent Dirichlet Allocation*](http://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume3/blei03a/blei03a.pdf) or LDA, a popular approach to topic modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "In many conventional NLP applications, documents are represented a mixture of the individual tokens (words and phrases) they contain. In other words, a document is represented as a *vector* of token counts. There are two layers in this model &mdash; documents and tokens &mdash; and the size or dimensionality of the document vectors is the number of tokens in the corpus vocabulary. This approach has a number of disadvantages:\n",
    "* Document vectors tend to be large (one dimension for each token $\\Rightarrow$ lots of dimensions)\n",
    "* They also tend to be very sparse. Any given document only contains a small fraction of all tokens in the vocabulary, so most values in the document's token vector are 0.\n",
    "* The dimensions are fully indepedent from each other &mdash; there's no sense of connection between related tokens, such as _knife_ and _fork_.\n",
    "\n",
    "LDA injects a third layer into this conceptual model. Documents are represented as a mixture of a pre-defined number of *topics*, and the *topics* are represented as a mixture of the individual tokens in the vocabulary. The number of topics is a model hyperparameter selected by the practitioner. LDA makes a prior assumption that the (document, topic) and (topic, token) mixtures follow [*Dirichlet*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirichlet_distribution) probability distributions. This assumption encourages documents to consist mostly of a handful of topics, and topics to consist mostly of a modest set of the tokens."

    "  * The relative size of a topic's circle in the plot corresponds to the relative frequency of the topic in the corpus.\n",
    "  * An individual topic may be selected for closer scrutiny by clicking on its circle, or entering its number in the \"selected topic\" box in the upper-left.\n",
    "* On the right, there is a bar chart showing top terms.\n",
    "  * When no topic is selected in the plot on the left, the bar chart shows the top-30 most \"salient\" terms in the corpus. A term's *saliency* is a measure of both how frequent the term is in the corpus and how \"distinctive\" it is in distinguishing between different topics.\n",
    "  * When a particular topic is selected, the bar chart changes to show the top-30 most \"relevant\" terms for the selected topic. The relevance metric is controlled by the parameter $\\lambda$, which can be adjusted with a slider above the bar chart.\n",
    "    * Setting the $\\lambda$ parameter close to 1.0 (the default) will rank the terms solely according to their probability within the topic.\n",
    "    * Setting $\\lambda$ close to 0.0 will rank the terms solely according to their \"distinctiveness\" or \"exclusivity\" within the topic &mdash; i.e., terms that occur *only* in this topic, and do not occur in other topics.\n",
    "    * Setting $\\lambda$ to values between 0.0 and 1.0 will result in an intermediate ranking, weighting term probability and exclusivity accordingly.\n",

    "### Analyzing our LDA model\n",
    "The interactive visualization pyLDAvis produces is helpful for both:\n",
    "1. Better understanding and interpreting individual topics, and\n",
    "1. Better understanding the relationships between the topics.\n",
    "\n",
    "For (1), you can manually select each topic to view its top most freqeuent and/or \"relevant\" terms, using different values of the $\\lambda$ parameter. This can help when you're trying to assign a human interpretable name or \"meaning\" to each topic.\n",
    "\n",
    "For (2), exploring the _Intertopic Distance Plot_ can help you learn about how topics relate to each other, including potential higher-level structure between groups of topics.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our plot, there is a stark divide along the x-axis, with two topics far to the left and most of the remaining 48 far to the right. Inspecting the two outlier topics provides a plausible explanation: both topics contain many non-English words, while most of the rest of the topics are in English. So, one of the main attributes that distinguish the reviews in the dataset from one another is their language.\n",
    "\n",
    "This finding isn't entirely a surprise. In addition to English-speaking cities, the Yelp dataset includes reviews of businesses in Montreal and Karlsruhe, Germany, often written in French and German, respectively. Multiple languages isn't a problem for our demo, but for a real NLP application, you might need to ensure that the text you're processing is written in English (or is at least tagged for language) before passing it along to some downstream processing. If that were the case, the divide along the x-axis in the topic plot would immediately alert you to a potential data quality issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "The y-axis separates two large groups of topics &mdash; let's call them \"super-topics\" &mdash; one in the upper-right quadrant and the other in the lower-right quadrant. These super-topics correlate reasonably well with the pattern we'd noticed while naming the topics:\n",
    "* The super-topic in the *lower*-right tends to be about *food*. It groups together the **burger & fries**, **breakfast**, **sushi**, **barbecue**, and **greek** topics, among others.\n",
    "* The super-topic in the *upper*-right tends to be about other elements of the *restaurant experience*. It groups together the **ambience & seating**, **location & time**, **family**, and **customer service** topics, among others.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, in addition to the 50 direct topics the model has learned, our analysis suggests a higher-level pattern in the data. Restaurant reviewers in the Yelp dataset talk about two main things in their reviews, in general: (1) the food, and (2) their overall restaurant experience. For this dataset, this is a very intuitive result, and we probably didn't need a sophisticated modeling technique to tell it to us. When working with datasets from other domains, though, such high-level patterns may be much less obvious from the outset &mdash; and that's where topic modeling can help."

Once an LDA model has been trained, it can be used to represent free text as a mixture of the topics the model learned from the original corpus. This mixture can be interpreted as a probability distribution across the topics, so the LDA representation of a paragraph of text might look like 50% _Topic A_, 20% _Topic B_, 20% _Topic C_, and 10% _Topic D_.\n",

    "The goal of *word vector embedding models*, or *word vector models* for short, is to learn dense, numerical vector representations for each term in a corpus vocabulary. If the model is successful, the vectors it learns about each term should encode some information about the *meaning* or *concept* the term represents, and the relationship between it and other terms in the vocabulary. Word vector models are also fully unsupervised &mdash; they learn all of these meanings and relationships solely by analyzing the text of the corpus, without any advance knowledge provided.\n",
    "\n",
    "Perhaps the best-known word vector model is [word2vec](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1301.3781v3.pdf), originally proposed in 2013. The general idea of word2vec is, for a given *focus word*, to use the *context* of the word &mdash; i.e., the other words immediately before and after it &mdash; to provide hints about what the focus word might mean. To do this, word2vec uses a *sliding window* technique, where it considers snippets of text only a few tokens long at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the start of the learning process, the model initializes random vectors for all terms in the corpus vocabulary. The model then slides the window across every snippet of text in the corpus, with each word taking turns as the focus word. Each time the model considers a new snippet, it tries to learn some information about the focus word based on the surrouding context, and it \"nudges\" the words' vector representations accordingly. One complete pass sliding the window across all of the corpus text is known as a training *epoch*. It's common to train a word2vec model for multiple passes/epochs over the corpus. Over time, the model rearranges the terms' vector representations such that terms that frequently appear in similar contexts have vector representations that are *close* to each other in vector space.\n",

    "For a deeper dive into word2vec's machine learning process, see [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.2738v4.pdf).\n",

    "Word2vec has a number of user-defined hyperparameters, including:\n",
